#### Architecture Overview:
The architecture of the Flutter application is designed to efficiently manage the state of dynamic forms while ensuring flexibility and extensibility. Key components include:
- **Riverpod for State Management:** Riverpod is utilized for managing the state of the form, including the visibility and values of the fields. Riverpod allows for a declarative approach to state management, making it easier to manage and update state throughout the application.
- **FormState Class:** The `FormState` class extends `ChangeNotifier` to manage the state of the form. It stores form fields, their visibility conditions, and form data. It also provides methods to update form field values and load form data from JSON.
- **FormFieldModel:** This class represents individual form fields, including their properties such as field name, widget type, valid values for dropdowns, and visibility conditions. It provides methods to evaluate visibility conditions based on the current form state.

#### Dynamic Form Generation Logic:
The application dynamically generates and displays forms based on JSON input. The dynamic form generation logic includes:
- **Parsing JSON Input:** The application accepts JSON input defining form fields, their types, valid values for dropdowns, and visibility conditions. It parses this JSON input and converts it into `FormFieldModel` objects.
- **Form Rendering:** Using the parsed `FormFieldModel` objects, the application dynamically renders form fields. It checks the visibility condition for each field to determine whether it should be displayed based on the current form state.
- **Optimized Widget Builds:** Widget builds are optimized to include only necessary updates. The visibility condition evaluation ensures that only visible form fields are rendered, minimizing unnecessary widget rebuilds and enhancing performance.

### Guide on Using the Application with Different JSON Inputs:
To use the application with different JSON inputs and create dynamic forms, follow these steps:

1. **Define JSON Input:** Create a JSON file defining the form fields, their types, valid values for dropdowns, and visibility conditions. Below is an example JSON structure:
   ```json
   [
     { "field_name": "f1", "widget": "dropdown", "valid_values": ["A", "B"] },
     { "field_name": "f2", "widget": "textfield", "visible": "f1=='A'" },
     { "field_name": "f3", "widget": "textfield", "visible": "f1=='A'" },
     { "field_name": "f4", "widget": "textfield", "visible": "f1=='A'" },
     { "field_name": "f5", "widget": "textfield", "visible": "f1=='B'" },
     { "field_name": "f6", "widget": "textfield", "visible": "f1=='B'" }
   ]
   ```
2. **Load JSON Input:** Press the "Load Form" button in the application to load the JSON input. This will parse the JSON input and dynamically generate the form based on the defined fields.
3. **Interact with the Form:** Interact with the dynamically generated form. Dropdown selections will trigger visibility changes for related text fields based on the defined visibility conditions.
4. **Modify JSON Input:** Modify the JSON input as needed to add, remove, or modify form fields. The application will adapt to any modifications in the JSON structure and dynamically update the form accordingly.

By following these steps, users can easily create and interact with dynamic forms using different JSON inputs, leveraging the flexibility and extensibility of the application architecture.
